		// be predicated upon unstable state. For instance, a node may reject a
		// vote for one peer because it has already begun syncing its vote for
		// another peer. Or it may reject a vote from one peer because it has
		// unstable log entries that indicate that the peer is behind on its
		// log. In these cases, it is likely safe to send out the rejection
		// response immediately without compromising safety in the presence of a
		// server restart. However, because these rejections are rare and
